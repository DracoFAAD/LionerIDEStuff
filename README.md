# Welcome! 
You probably found this github by either looking at my profile or by looking at my application! I appreciate a lot that you are actually trying to learn what this is.

To start off, lets explain the branches, shall we?

## LionerIDE (Branch)
This is what the Launcher installs. Version check is done there too.

## Monaco (Branch)
This is the monaco installation branch! It is also known as the "Code editor". The magic in writing happens there!
